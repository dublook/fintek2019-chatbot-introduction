ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡<br>
**Put your ideas into acutual solution/product**<br>
ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†<br>

## How to achieve my mission
### Today (Next step from Design Thinking)
- Tell how entrepreneurs think
- Make a prototype for your chat bot app
  - Volunteers are needed!

### Next week (lots about engineering)
- Intoduce to how to make acutual chat bot app
- And...<br><br><br><br><br>Hot to get **S Grade** at this class

# How entrepreneurs think

## Is it related to chat bot??
YES.

**Cool apps will NOT be created student mind**

## Some ways to think what I've changed
## 1. Goal Oriented (vs Process Oriented)
- Markdown vs PowerPoint
- Suits vs Movie T-Shirt

## 2. Never 'enough facts'
- Never
- Or, it's too late
- But, of course, we have to collect facts

## 3. JUST Ideas are NOT Worth Spreading
- Try to let someone steal your idea
- Idea + Product + Actual Users

**In this class, You are an entrepreneur**

(Take a rest)

## Making prototype of a Chat Bot app
- Introduce some chat bot

## Why Chat Bot
- Other solutions
  - iOS/Android apps
  - Web App
  - Windos/Mac app
  - Blockchain app
  - Hardware, IoT
- Pros for users
  - Don't have to install new apps
  - Easy to add/remove app
  - Simple UI (user interface)
- Pros for you as a entrepreneur (or engineer)
  - You don't have to handle design matters a lots
  - You can focus on input/output between chat bot app and a user
  - Easy for programming beginners

**But this does NOT mean you are not allowed to choose other solutions**


## Let's build a simple prototype with LINE Bot Designer!
- A volunteer comes here
- Explain business idea
- Put that idea into chat bot prototype with bot designer with me

## Start from Design Thinking
> Design Thinking is useful for understanding real needs of clients

(from Pr. Fukuhara's)

**real needs of clients**

Too many buttons are awful ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”??

-> It depends on needs


## Three questions when you get lost
1. Please explain your idea in 1 minute
2. What is the users' biggest problem?
3. How your chat bot app will solve that problem and make users happy?
